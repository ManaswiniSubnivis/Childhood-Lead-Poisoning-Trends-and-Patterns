# Childhood-Lead-Poisoning-Trends-and-Patterns
It is important to note that children are more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults and therefore, governments and regulatory bodies across the world are seeking to put a lid on it. No level of lead in the blood is safe and children who have consumed lead do not look or act sick. It remains in there for a long while and acts slowly to adversely affect the nervous system, the kidneys and the overall growth and development of a child.

Through this project, I am trying to understand and visualize the patterns of lead poisoning in children throughout the United States of America (in tandem with the world) and the State of Connecticut in particular.
